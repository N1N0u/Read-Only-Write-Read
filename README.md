# Read-Only-Write-Read
batch Files for windows to switch usb from read-write to read-only and vise versa
in case of anyone uses it make sure to change to usb drive name if the batch files (i used E for example, change it to whatever you want)
please don't use it on C drive or where the OS is installed (system might crash!!!)
